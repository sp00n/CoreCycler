This tool lets you allow to get and set the Curve Optimizer values via the command line.

Usage:
To get the currently applied Curve Optimizer values:
pbotest.exe get

To set new Curve Optimizer values:
pbotest.exe set CO_Core0 CO_Core1 [...] CO_CoreMax


For example, to set the Curve Optimizer values for a 6 core processor:
pbotest.exe set -20 2 -15 -20 -19 -5

Note the minus sign for negative Curve Optimizer values.
You need to provide a value for each core in your processor, otherwise the tool will throw an error message.
